                            Lalbagh is one of the oldest botanical gardens in India and is also a major tourist attraction in South India. Located in South Bengaluru, the Lalbagh Botanical Garden is not only one of the largest botanical gardens in India, but also the first of its kind, with planned routes, glasshouses and ornamental flowers growing throughout the property.

                            The garden itself is spread over an area of 240 acres and its construction was commissioned by the famous ruler Hyder Ali. It was finally completed by his son- Tipu Sultan- who designed the gardens keeping in mind the beautiful gardens of Sira in Tumkur District in Karnataka.

                            Lalbagh is home to exotic flowers that were imported by the Sultan from countries like France, Persia, Arabia, Afghanistan, etc. Therefore, flowers that were previously never seen in India were first witnessed in this historical garden. Trees that were imported by Tipu Sultan from all over the world can still be found growing here.

                            Spread over an area of 300 acres, Cubbon Park in the city of Bangalore is a major sightseeing attraction rich in green foliage. It is a green belt region of the city and is an
                            ideal place for nature lovers and those seeking a calm atmosphere. Having been laid down by Lord Cubbon, the park is named so in his honour. It is home to more than 6,000 trees that
                            support a vibrant ecosystem. In addition to being a natural sightseeing destination, some of the major structures of the city such as the Attara Kacheri, Cubbon Park Museum and
                            Sheshadri Iyer Memorial Park are also situated here. Another famous attraction in the Cubbon Park is The Bangalore Aquarium, which is the second largest aquarium in India.

                            In the year 1927, the park was officially renamed as "Sri. Chamarajendra Park" to mark the Silver Jubilee of Sri. Krishnaraja Wodeyar's rule in Mysore State. At present, the Cubbon
                            Park is under the control of the Department of Horticulture. The Deputy Director of Horticulture (Cubbon Park) is responsible for the administration and maintenance of the park.

                            An epitome of great architecture and beauty, The Majestic Bangalore Palace preserves in it the spice of old regal opulence. Currently the central attraction in Bangalore, the palace was built in the year 1878. Chamarajendra Wadiyar's British Guardians bought the original property in 1873 from the principal of Bangalore Central High School, Rev, J Garret, from his funds.
                            Apart from being a major tourist destination, the palace is a host to different cultural events, rock shows, and marriages. As per beliefs, King Chamarajendra Wadiyar drew his inspiration for building the palace from the Windsor Castle of London. The granite seats decorated with fluorescent blue ceramic tiles on the ground floor, a fairy tale Ballroom, the famous painter Raja Ravi Varma's paintings, vine-covered walls, and the Durbar Hall on the first floor come together to form the prepossessing Bangalore Palace.
                            A visit to the palace gives you a chance to witness the elegant and lavish splendour of one of the most powerful dynasties of South India. An audio tape is available inside the Palace, both in Hindi and English, to help the people having language issues, understand its history better.

                            One of the very famous Hindu temples in the city, ISKCON Temple has become the landmark location in north
                            Bangalore. For many settled abroad, Hinduism and ISKCON are often synonymous. It is an institution for
                            learning, practicing and preaching many Hindu beliefs. It is a one stop place for worshipping many gods—Lord
                            Krishna, Radha, Govinda, Narasimha etc. The highlighting feature about ISKCON, Bangalore, is its famous Akshayapatra
                            Foundation. They distribute free food for the children in government and government-aided schools across India. This initiative
                            is much appreciated world-wide and many foreigners have been funding this campaign too. The temple has a magnificent architecture
                            spread over several acres of land. The temple is at an altitude higher than the road level and helps the passers-by to easily
                            catch a glimpse of it while on their way. The temple is too huge not to be noticed while on the Chord Road of the Rajajinagar area
                            in Bangalore.
